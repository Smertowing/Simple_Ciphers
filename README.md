***The essence of the permutation methods is that the original message is M
divided into data blocks consisting of d characters M = m1, ..., md, md + 1, ..., m2d, ...,
after which the resulting blocks of source text are converted in accordance with
some vector, function or figure.***

Cryptographic systems based on the substitution method can
divided into four main classes:

***1. Single-alphabetic substitution cipher (simple substitution cipher) - cipher
where each plaintext character is replaced by some
fixed for this key with the symbol of the same alphabet. Example
Caesar's cipher can serve.***

***2. A monotone substitution cipher (homophonic) is similar to
single alphabetic except that the plaintext character can
be replaced by one of several possible characters. To these ciphers
carry the cipher bill.***

***3. The polygram substitution cipher replaces not one character, but a whole
group of characters. Examples of such ciphers are the Playfeira cipher, the cipher
Hill's***

***4. The multi-alphabet substitution cipher consists of several ciphers.
easy replacement. For example, cipher Vizhenera, disposable notebook.***
